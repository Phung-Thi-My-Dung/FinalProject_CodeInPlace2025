# Truc Xanh Music Game

Welcome to **Truc Xanh Music**, a memory-matching game developed for Code in Place Stanford 2025! Test your auditory and memory skills by matching pairs of cards that play the same musical note. The game features 7 musical notes (C4 to B4) and two game modes with 15 or 25 pairs of cards.

## Game Overview
- **Objective**: Match pairs of cards that produce the same musical note (e.g., two cards both playing C4).
- **Notes**: The game uses 7 musical notes: C4, D4, E4, F4, G4, A4, and B4.
- **Modes**:
  - **15 Pairs Mode**: Match 15 pairs of cards.
  - **25 Pairs Mode**: Match 25 pairs of cards for a greater challenge.
- **Winning**: Successfully match all pairs to win the game!

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed. The game requires additional libraries listed in `requirements.txt`.

### Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd truc-xanh-music
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the Game
1. After installing the dependencies, run the main game file:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
2. The game will start, and you can choose between the 15-pair or 25-pair mode.
3. Click on two cards to reveal their notes. If they match, they stay open; if not, they flip back. Continue until all pairs are matched!

## How to Play
- Select a game mode (15 or 25 pairs).
- Click on a card to play its note and reveal it. **Focus on listening to the sound** rather than relying on visual cues, as the cards are designed to emphasize auditory matching.
- Click on a second card to hear its note and check for a match. **Train your ear** to identify when the two notes sound identical (e.g., both cards play C4).
- If the notes match (same pitch and sound), the cards remain face-up. If they donâ€™t, they flip back.
- Continue matching pairs by listening carefully to the notes. This game helps improve your auditory memory and pitch recognition skills!
- Match all pairs to win the game.

## Notes
- The game relies heavily on audio feedback, so ensure your device's sound is on.
- The notes range from C4 to B4, providing a variety of tones to distinguish.
- Practice your listening skills to differentiate between the 7 notes, as visual cues are minimal to encourage ear training.
